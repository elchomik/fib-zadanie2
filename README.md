AWS Deployment with GitHub Actions

#Deployment not working
If you want to deploy your application on AWS Cloud you need to provide your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY 
I don't have an account on AWS so this is why deployment doesn't work. You need to be aware that AWS CLOUD is payable cloud and
you should pass your card ID to be able to use all functionalities of cloud.
